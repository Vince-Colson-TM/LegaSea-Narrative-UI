## Project Overview

This research is part of the **LegaSea project**, a collaborative initiative that aims to reconstruct Dutch Ice Age biomes through an AI-assisted citizen science approach. The project focuses on late-Quaternary vertebrate fossils (130,000 years ago to present) found in the North Sea Basin, building upon over 75,000 citizen science images collected through the oervondstchecker.nl platform.



## Research Question

**Main Question:** How can a narrative-based user interface enhance user engagement, data completeness, and trust in AI-powered fossil identification?

### Research Focus Areas

- **User Engagement**: How conversational interaction affects motivation and participation compared to traditional forms
- **Data Quality**: Whether guided, conversational metadata collection improves completeness and accuracy
- **Trust in AI**: How transparent, conversational AI communication affects user confidence
- **Usability**: How users with different expertise levels experience narrative-based interfaces

## Background & Problem Statement

The current fossil data collection process on oervondstchecker.nl faces several challenges:

- **Static workflow**: Manual classification by volunteer experts creates processing delays
- **Form-based limitations**: Traditional interfaces constrain data richness and consistency
- **No mobile solution**: Lack of real-time guidance tools for field identification
- **Limited engagement**: Generic forms provide minimal educational value during submission

This research explores whether conversational, chat-like interfaces can address these limitations by providing:
- Real-time AI feedback during data collection
- Adaptive questioning based on user expertise
- Enhanced engagement through storytelling elements
- Transparent AI decision-making processes

## Research Methodology

### Mixed-Methods Approach

1. **Literature Review**: Systematic analysis of conversational UI design and citizen science platforms
2. **Prototype Development**: Three functional web-based prototypes:
   - **Prototype A**: Traditional form-based interface (baseline)
   - **Prototype B**: Basic conversational interface with AI-powered chat
   - **Prototype C**: Narrative-enhanced interface with storytelling and personalization
3. **User Testing**: Within-subjects design with fossil enthusiasts and citizen scientists
4. **Data Analysis**: Quantitative metrics (completion rates, accuracy) and qualitative feedback

### Key Features

- Real-time AI integration (GPT-4/Claude APIs)
- Mobile-optimized responsive design
- Comprehensive interaction logging
- Adaptive conversational flows based on user expertise
